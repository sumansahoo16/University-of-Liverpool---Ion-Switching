# University-of-Liverpool---Ion-Switching


### Problem Statement

Ion channels are pore-forming membrane proteins, that allow ions to pass through the channel pore. When ion channels open, they pass electric currents.
Existing methods of detecting these state changes are slow and laborious.

### Data
- A timestamp
- Ampere values (current) for each timestamp. These values were measured at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz.
- The corresponding number of open channels at that timestamp (only provided for the train data).
